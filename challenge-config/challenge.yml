  ### Privilege escalation using SUID binary

  This challenge is just a simple challenge where the SUID bit has been set for the find command in linux.
  From a non root user you will be able to escalate your privileges because the find command can execute shell commands itself.
  The challenge uses port 22 to setup a SSH server which the exploiter will be able to join.

  **Prerequisites**

  * Basic linux terminal usage
  * Knowledge of SUID binaries

  **Outcome**

  * Practical knowledge of what a priviledge escalation is
  * Gain more knowledge about dangers of SUID
